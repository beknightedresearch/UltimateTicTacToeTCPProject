Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe has three levels of difficulty.
Level One (3x3 Board):
This is just Tic-Tac-Toe. Players alternate turns and the aim is to get 3 in a row.

Level Two (9x9 Board):
This level is the original Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. There are 9 simulatenous games of Tic-Tac-Toe 
embedded in a large game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
The first move is open anywhere on the board. Afterwards, the next player must move relative
to the last move. For example, suppose a player played in the top right square of the small
Tic-Tac-Toe board. Then, the next player must play in one of the 9 smaller squares contained
within the top right square of the large Tic-Tac-Toe board.

Level Three (27x27 Board):
This is extreme Tic-Tac-Toe. There is a large Tic-Tac-Toe board embedded with 9 games of 
Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. As before, the first move is open. Afterwards, where in the medium size board
a player plays in forces which square of the large board the next player plays in 
(left middle->left middle, right bottom->right bottom, etc). Further, where in the small
size board a player plays forces which square of the medium board plays in.
This means a choice made two turns ago restricts the current choice.
